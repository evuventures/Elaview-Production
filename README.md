# ðŸ“Œ What is Elaview?

 Elaview is a B2B marketplace that connects landlords who have physical advertising space â€” like building walls, windows, vehicles, or billboards â€” with businesses looking to rent those spaces for ads.
 
 Using Elaview patented technology, we calculate rental value by how much foot traffic/view rate your ad space receives!

## :gear: How it Works:

1. Landlords list their available ad spaces with photos, location details, pricing, and availability.
2. Ad spaces are valued by how much traffic they receive; determined by Elaview technology.
3. Advertisers browse and filter listings by location, type, and budget to find the perfect space.
4. Businesses can inquire, book, or lease directly through the platform, streamlining the ad space rental process.


## :bulb: What it Does:
Elaview makes it easy for landlords to monetize unused space and for businesses to access unique, real-world advertising opportunities â€” all in one platform.
