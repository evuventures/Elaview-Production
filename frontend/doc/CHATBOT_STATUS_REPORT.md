# ðŸ”§ Enhanced Chatbot - Issues Fixed & Status Report

## âœ… **Issues Successfully Resolved**

### 1. **Router Context Error**
**Problem:** `ChatBotProvider` was trying to use `useLocation()` before the Router was initialized
**Solution:** Moved `ChatBotProvider` inside the Router context in `src/pages/Index.jsx`

### 2. **Authentication Errors (403 Forbidden)**
**Problem:** Context was trying to load user data before authentication was complete
**Solution:** 
- Added `useAuth` from Clerk to check authentication status
- Only load data when user is signed in (`isSignedIn && isLoaded`)
- Added proper error handling for unauthenticated states

### 3. **Context Awareness Issues**
**Problem:** Chatbot wasn't properly handling different authentication states
**Solution:**
- Enhanced welcome message with authentication-aware content
